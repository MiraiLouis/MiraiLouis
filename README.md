Hello! My name is Louis CHEN, I am a graduate AI Engineer from CY Tech (Cergy) and I am currently seeking a full-time position (CDI) in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

I’m passionate about AI, IT, engineering, and sciences. What drives me most is building intelligent systems, solving complex problems, and working on innovative, high-impact projects.

During my studies and professional experiences, I developed solid skills in machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering, and I’m eager to apply them in a challenging industrial or research-oriented environment.
